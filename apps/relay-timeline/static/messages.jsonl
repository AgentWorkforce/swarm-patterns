Keep routes: `/sessions` (list), `/sessions/[id]` (detail), optional `/live` alias.\n- Data fetching via `+page.ts` load for initial SSR (list + first page of events); live updates via WS in `onMount`.\n\nState management\n- Svelte stores: `sessionStore` (map by id, meta/stats), `eventStore` (by session id with cursor, capped buffer), `connectionStore` (ws status, filters). Avoid global UI state besides theme.\n- Derive memoized slices (per session) to keep renders cheap; virtualize event list.\n\nData flow expectations\n- REST backfill: `GET /sessions?limit&page&agent&from&to`, `GET /sessions/:id`, `GET /sessions/:id/events?cursor&types` (JSON/JSONL). Assume cursor-based pagination.\n- Live: `WS /ws/sessions/:id` sends ordered `Event {ts, sessionId, kind:'daemon'|'relay'|'pty'|'agent', subtype, source, target?, payload}`. Client may send filter/cursor.\n- Merge events by timestamp; de-dup by `id` if present. Show loading/empty/error states.\n\nComponent boundaries\n- `SessionList` (filters, status chips, search); `SessionCard` row; `SessionDetailLayout` with two panes.\n- Left pane: `EventTimeline` (virtualized list, filter bar, severity color); `EventInspector` for selected event payload.\n- Right pane: `TopologyGraph` (Svelvet) with nodes: daemon, relay-pty instances, agents, channels; animate edges on traffic.\n- `StatsBar` for throughput/latency; `ConnectionBadge` for WS status; `ControlBar` for play/pause live, time window, type filters.\n\nAnimation budget\n- Target total JS <80KB gzip. Prefer Svelte transitions (`fly/fade/scale`, springs) for enter/leave; use GSAP only for complex sequences/timelines. Limit simultaneous animations; 60fps goal on mid-tier laptop. Disable heavy motion when `prefers-reduced-motion`.\n\nSecurity & PTY content\n- Treat PTY payload as untrusted text: escape HTML, render monospace, support line wrapping toggle. Consider highlighting suspicious injection markers but never execute.\n- If showing command verification, annotate trust level (signed/unknown) and source; avoid clickable links in PTY output by default.\n- Cap displayed chunk size; indicate truncated output; avoid storing secrets in localStorage.\n\nOther UX constraints\n- Must handle large sessions (>2k events): use virtualization, incremental graph updates, and debounced layout.\n- Offline/WS drop: show reconnect with backoff; keep cached events until reconnected.\n- Theming: light/dark via CSS vars; define tokens for colors (kinds), radii, motion durations.\n\nIf you need sample fixture JSON for scaffolding before backend lands, ping me—I’ll provide session + event samples and a mock WS handler.","deliverySeq":3,"deliverySessionId":"ml04pmr8-0001-1pmqq3hf","sessionId":"ml04pmr8-0001-1pmqq3hf","status":"unread","is_urgent":false,"is_broadcast":false}}
